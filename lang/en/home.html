      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <div class="photo-text-section">
        <div class="text">
          <p>
            Hello, I'm Tomasz Zbroszczyk, and I'm a 20-year-old proud Warsaw, Poland native.
            Born and raised in this vibrant city, I've grown to cherish the culture and opportunities it offers.
          </p>
          <p>
            My academic journey led me to the Faculty of Mathematics and Information Sciences at Warsaw University of Technology,
            where I'm currently in my second year, specializing in Computer Science and Information Systems, with all classes conducted in English.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of academics, I'm fueled by a diverse range of passions. My love for cooking is a delightful way to unwind and express my creativity in the kitchen.
          </p>
          <p>
            But it's my lifelong dedication to Karate Kyokushin that has shaped me in many ways.
            I've been training in this discipline since the age of 5, and I'm committed to continuing this incredible journey,
            thanks to the enduring principles and life skills instilled by my devoted coach.
          </p>
          <p>
            My journey into the world of information technology commenced when I was just 13 years old, all thanks to my mom's encouragement.
            Her unwavering support ignited my passion for IT, leading me to experiment with simple .bat files. This ignited a fire within me,
            and I ventured into the world of Java programming, which quickly became my favorite programming language.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to my academic and IT interests, I'm an adventurer at heart.
            I thrive on the adrenaline and exhilaration that extreme sports offer. Skydiving, diving, and free diving have become integral to my life.
          </p>
          <p>
            Skydiving, in particular, has captured my heart, and I aspire to earn my skydiving license someday.
            Thanks to the unwavering support of my friends and family, I've had the privilege of leaping from an aircraft with a parachute, an experience that has left me hungry for more exhilarating dives.
          </p>
          <p>
            Diving has opened up the enchanting underwater world to me, and in this year, I acquired my scuba diving license.
            Thanks to my dad's influence, I've also discovered the joys of free diving for recreational purposes whenever time allows.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's thanks to my dad's encouragement and free diving that I was able to recreate one of my dream photos, which you can admire on the right.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm excited to share my academic and personal journeys with you, and I'm always ready to embark on new adventures. Thank you for visiting my website!
