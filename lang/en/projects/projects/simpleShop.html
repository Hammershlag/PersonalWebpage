    <h1>SimpleShop: My Android Development Journey</h1>
</div>

<div class="section" id="simpleShop">
    <p>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        Several years ago, I embarked on a journey to learn Android app development, culminating in the creation of SimpleShop, an e-commerce application designed to reinforce my programming and design skills.
        Even though it may look like a simple application, I tried adding everything that came into my mind. Starting from logging it or registering, through email verification to the things like primitive credit card verification methods.
        It is easier to just look at my code than for me to explain everything, but I will try my best to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
        <h2>Loading</h2>
        Let's start with loading. When the app was opened it first entered loading stage where everything such as
        user's decision to stay logged in or not and then sending them to appropriate page depending on their decision
        and even their 'ROLE'. While on this stage, I also asked user for any missing permissions.
    </p>
    <p>
        <h2>Login</h2>
        I enabled users to login from the users stored in database. You were able to go to 'Registration' page if you didn't have an account yet,
        but if you had one you could just log in. Obviously if you remembered your password. If you didn't, I added functionality to reset your password using verification code
        sent to your email address.
    </p>
    <p>
        <h2>Register</h2>
        Next thing is a registration page. Only thing I added to casual registration was email verification by sending
        verification code to the given email and if the entered code was correct, the application added user to the database with a default role.
    </p>
    <p>
        <h2>Storing Data</h2>
        If I wanted to store some data and be sure that it was accessible from all pages, I added it to my class 'Data' that only
        contained static field. It might have not been the smartest thing to do but at that time it was the only thing I came up with.
    </p>

            <h2>Key Features</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>User Authentication: Login and registration functionalities.</li>
                <li>User Roles: Distinct roles for admin and users, controlling access and permissions.</li>
                <li>Product Management: Users can submit products for admin approval before they are listed.</li>
                <li>Local Data Storage: Utilizes SQLite for data management and SharedPreferences for settings.</li>
                <li>User Verification: After registration you get verification code on your email</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Challenges and Learning</h2>
            <p>Although SimpleShop was one of my early projects and did not fully adhere to Object-Oriented Design principles or security best practices, it was a significant step in my development journey, teaching me valuable lessons in Android app development, local data storage, and UI/UX considerations.
            It was one of the projects that I didn't have to extend by force. All the ideas came to my mind before I was finished with previous ones</p>

        <li>Language: Java</li>
        <li>Time: September 2021</li>
    </ul>
    At that time I was not the best programmer, and I was not very proficient at using git so please take that into account while looking at this project on my GitHub.
