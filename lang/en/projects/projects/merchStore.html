    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    MerchStore is a comprehensive e-commerce platform developed using Java and Spring Boot for the backend, and JavaScript for the frontend. It is designed to provide a seamless online shopping experience, offering a wide range of features that cater to both buyers and sellers. For buyers, the application offers a user-friendly interface to browse items, add them to their cart, and proceed to checkout. It also provides a personalized shopping experience by remembering the user's browsing history and showing them their most recently viewed items. The application also supports a cart system where users can add items they wish to purchase, and when ready, they can proceed to a secure checkout process. For sellers, the application provides an easy-to-use platform to list their items for sale. They can add detailed descriptions, set prices, and offer discounts. The application also features a robust advertisement system with different statuses (active, inactive, deleted), allowing sellers to manage their listings effectively. The application also integrates with an external API to fetch and update the current exchange rates, ensuring that all transactions are carried out with the most recent and accurate exchange rates. This feature is particularly useful for international transactions, providing users with the most accurate pricing in their local currency. </p> <p> <h2>Authentication</h2> Security is a top priority in MerchStore. The application provides secure login and registration functionalities, using advanced encryption techniques to protect user data. It also supports different roles for users, including owner, admin, and user, each with their own set of permissions and access levels. This role-based access control ensures that sensitive operations are only accessible to authorized users. </p> <p> <h2>Exchange Rate API</h2> The application integrates with an external API to fetch and update the current exchange rates. This feature ensures that all transactions are carried out with the most recent and accurate exchange rates. It provides users with real-time pricing information, making it easier for them to make informed purchasing decisions. </p> <p> <h2>Error Handling</h2> The application includes a custom error page to handle any unexpected errors or exceptions. This ensures a smooth user experience even when something goes wrong. The error handling mechanism is designed to provide informative error messages, helping users understand what went wrong and how they can resolve the issue. </p> <p> <h2>E-commerce Features</h2> MerchStore offers a wide range of e-commerce features designed to enhance the online shopping experience. Users can browse items, add them to their cart, and proceed to checkout to make a purchase. The application also keeps track of the user's browsing history, showing them their most recently viewed items. Sellers can list their items for sale, add detailed descriptions, set prices, and offer discounts. The application also supports a robust advertisement system, allowing sellers to manage their listings effectively. </p> <p> <h2>Cookies</h2> The application uses cookies to enhance the user experience. Cookies are used to remember the user's login information, personalizing the user interface based on their preferences, and tracking their browsing history. This allows MerchStore to provide a more personalized and convenient shopping experience. </p>
